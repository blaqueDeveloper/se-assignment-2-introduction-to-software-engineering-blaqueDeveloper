        <em>Software engineering is a disciplined approach to designing, developing, testing and maintaining software applications and systems</em>
        <ol>
            <li>Approach</li>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Software Engineering: Focuses on the entire software development lifecycle, including planning, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. It emphasizes a systematic, structured approach with methodologies and best practices.</em></li>
                <li><em>Traditional Programming: Primarily involves writing code to solve specific problems or perform particular tasks. It often focuses on the coding phase without necessarily considering the broader context of the software's lifecycle.</em></li>
            </ul>
            <li>Team Collaboration</li>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Software Engineering: Involves collaboration among a diverse team, including project managers, software developers, testers, designers, and other stakeholders. Effective communication and coordination are crucial.</em></li>
                <li><em>Traditional Programming: Can be an individual activity, where a single programmer writes code independently.</em></li>
            </ul>
            <li>Methodologies and Processes</li>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Software Engineering: Utilizes various methodologies (such as Agile, Waterfall, Scrum) and processes to manage and control the development of software projects.</em></li>
                <li><em>Traditional Programming: May not adhere to formal methodologies. It can be more ad-hoc and less structured.</em></li>
            </ul>
            <li>Project Management</li>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Involves project management activities such as planning, scheduling, risk management, and resource allocation to ensure the project is completed on time and within budget.</em></li>
                <li><em>Traditional Programming: Often lacks formal project management practices, especially in smaller or less complex projects.</em></li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
    <li>Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):</li>
        <p><em>The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used by software engineers to develop software applications systematically. It consists of a series of stages that guide the software development process from initial concept to deployment and maintenance. </em></p>
    <li>Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.</li>
            <em><ol>
            <li>Planning:</li>
                <em>
                <p>This stage acts as the foundation of the whole SDLC scheme and paves the way for the successful execution of upcoming steps and, ultimately, a successful project launch. The problem the software targets is defined. The developers and other team members outline objectives for the system and draw a rough plan of how the system will work.</p>
                <p>At its core, the planning process helps identify how a specific problem can be solved with a certain software solution. Crucially, the planning stage involves analysis of the resources and costs needed to complete the project, as well as estimating the overall price of the software developed.</p>
                <p>Finally, the planning process clearly defines the outline of system development. The project manager will set deadlines and time frames for each phase of the software development life cycle, ensuring the product is presented to the market in time.</p><em>
            <li>Analysis</li>
                <em>
                <p>Once the planning is done, it’s time to switch to the research and analysis stage. 
                In this step, you incorporate more specific data for your new system. This includes the first system prototype drafts, market research, and an evaluation of competitors.</p>
                <p>To successfully complete the analysis and put together all the critical information for a certain project, developers should do the following:</p></em>
                <ul>
                    <li>Generate the system requirements</li>
                        <em><p>A Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document will be created at this stage. Your DevOps team should have a high degree of input in determining the functional and network requirements of the upcoming project.
                        </p></em>
                    <li>Evaluate existing prototypes</li>
                        <em><p>Different prototypes should be evaluated to identify those with the greatest potential. </p></em>
                    <li>Conduct market research</li>
                        <em><p>Market research is essential to define the pains and needs of end-consumers.</p></em>
                    <li>Set concrete goals</li>
                        <em><p>Goals are set and allocated to the stages of the system development life cycle. Often, these will correspond to the implementation of specific features.</p></em>
                </ul>
            <li>Design</li>
                <em><p>This is a critical step in developing the conceptual blueprint of a software project. This phase involves transforming the software requirements gathered during the Requirements Analysis phase into a structured design document.</p></em>
            <li>Development</li>
                <em><p>The system creation process produces a working solution. Developers write code and build the app according to the finalized requirements and specification documents. This stage includes both front and back-end development.</p></em>
            <li>Testing</li>
                <em><p>The testing stage ensures the application’s features work correctly and coherently and fulfill user objectives and expectations.</p>
                <p>This process involves detecting the possible bugs, defects, and errors, searching for vulnerabilities, and can sometimes take up even more time compared to the app-building stage.</p></em>
            <li>Integration and Implementation</li>
                <em><p>Once the product is ready to go, it’s time to make it available to its end users and deploy it to the production environment. </p>
                <p>At this stage, the software undergoes final testing through the training or pre-production environment, after which it’s ready for presentation on the market.</p></em>
            <li>Maintenance</li>
                <em><p>The maintenance stage is where the software is already being used by end-users.</p>
                <p>During the first couple of months, developers might face problems that weren’t detected during initial testing, so they should immediately react to the reported issues and implement the changes needed for the software’s stable and convenient usage.</p>
                <p>This is particularly important for large systems, which usually are more difficult to test in the debugging stage.</p></em>
        </ol><em>
    Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
    <li>Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?</li>
        <em><p> Waterfall is preferred for projects with well-defined requirements and a need for rigorous documentation, while Agile is better suited for projects that require flexibility, continuous customer feedback, and iterative progress.</p></em>
